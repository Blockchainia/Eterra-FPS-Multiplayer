An FPS multiplayer template with everything you'd need to get started. Includes a full map with custom 3d assets.
There is a fully featured main menu, pause menu and options panel. Did I also mention it has full controller support?
</p>

## Installation
  Open the godot project manager, switch to the asset library and search ``FPS multiplayer template`` and download. Another method is to clone the repo into your godot projects folder and open it from there.

## Features

## Assets
- The 3d assets are made by me and go by the same MIT license, so you are free to use them in your commercial games
- The textures are made by [kenny](https://kenney.itch.io/) and go by the CC0 license so if you like them please go [donate to them](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-donation)
